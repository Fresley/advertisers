Greetings!

This solution is not perfect and completed from lack of time.
It contains only three recommended endpoints, without grouping or filtering,
which are not challenging to implement. Similar there are no separate database
profiles and instances for testing, with test data, only script with few random values
executed at the beginning. Anyway it should give overall overview about my approach 
to implement such solutions. 
I'm eager to receive any comments towards my code :)
